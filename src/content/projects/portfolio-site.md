**The Inspiration**

I got to discover this framework through Dante de Ruwe at the Crafter Open Space organized by AE.

In his insightful 30-minute session, he broke down the modern landscape of self-hosting and demonstrated frameworks for building fast, maintainable static sites. That talk was the direct catalyst for this project.

**Technical Approach**

I chose Astro because it ships zero JavaScript to the client by default. This ensures the site loads instantly while allowing me to hydrate interactive components only when necessary this makes it also great for making quick changes and modifications later on.

Using Tailwind CSS allowed me to keep the styling consistent and responsive without writing heavy custom CSS files.
